# mupcr
## µPCR is a project aiming to bring biohacking to the masses through affordable open source hardware kits and software.


The µPCR1 (myu-PCR-one) is an affordable, easy to manufacture and use thermocycler that fits PCR tube sizes up to 11mm in outer diameter, such as Eppendorf 2ml Tubes.

The design is based around easily accesible parts such as:

- Raspberry Pi (any model from 2b)
- piTFT 2.8″ touchscreen
- MK8 hotend (most commonly found on amazon as a spare part for the Creality CR10 3D-printer)
- 250VAC relay (5v) for Arduino
- acrylic plastic and wood panel (3mm) (if using laser cut chassis)
- 3D-printed case (if using 3D-printed chassis)



The µPCR1 development prototype supports one pcr tube at a time but can easily be modified to add more due to its modular design.

µPCR1 features an intuitive user interface presented on the 2.8″ touch screen where thermocycling programs can easily be edited and run.

Fixed temperature programs can also be set for uses such as the heat shock method of transforming plasmid dna into E. coli.
