# mupcr
## µPCR is a project aiming to bring biohacking to the masses through affordable open source hardware kits and software.

The µPCR1 (myu-PCR-one) is an affordable, easy to manufacture and use thermocycler that fits PCR tube sizes up to 11mm in outer diameter, such as Eppendorf 2ml Tubes.

The design is based around easily accesible parts such as:

- Raspberry Pi (any model from 2b)
- piTFT 2.8″ touchscreen
- MK8 hotend (most commonly found on amazon as a spare part for the Creality CR10 3D-printer)
- 250VAC relay (5v) for Arduino
- acrylic plastic and wood panel (3mm) (if using laser cut chassis)
- 3D-printed case (if using 3D-printed chassis)
